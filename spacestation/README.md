# Matt's Spacestation

I was using Tris' ([NoBoilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/c/NoBoilerplate)) example from one of the videos. I took most of the code, changed some bits, added some bits.

## Lessons Learned

- How to install crates. Turns out its not like NPM with something like crate install or whatever. Just copy paste into the cargo.toml file. Which is really nice. Downloads on the next compile.

- Some finicky bits about the passing of mutable references.

- Probably some more.
