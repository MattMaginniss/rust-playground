# Matt's Rust Playground

In this repository you will see a bunch of random folder of stuff Matt (that's me) did in the early days of learning rust. Have fun! (It's proabably horrendous)

## FAQ

#### Why are you putting everything in one repo?

Just makes it easier, doesn't it?

#### Yeah but now they're all smushed together and cant be used independently?

Don't care. Just want a simple place to store all these bits.

## Lessons Learned

Rust is neat and I need to be a better programmer.
